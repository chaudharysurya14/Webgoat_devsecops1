== Landing page

This page will show all the requests made to '/landing/**'. This means
you can use WebWolf as your landing page for harvesting cookies etc. which
is helpful when you perform an XSS lesson.

Suppose we tricked a user into clicking on a link he/she received in an email. This link will open up our crafted
password reset link page. The user does not notice any differences compared to the normal password reset page of the company.
The user enters a new password and hits enter. The new password will be sent to your host. In this case, the new
password will be sent to WebWolf. Try to locate the unique code.

Please be aware that the user will receive an error page after resetting the password. In a real attack scenario the user would probably see a normal success page (this is due to a limit on what we can control with WebWolf)
